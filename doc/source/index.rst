Courses is a simple Django app to manage online courses (education). Application is already used by civic association
`SPy o.z. <https://python.sk/o_nas/>`_ (non-profit) for project "Teaching with hardware" in Slovak "Učíme s hardvérom":
https://kurzy.ucimesharverom.sk

Project "Učíme s hardvérom" is run in Slovak language (however this app is in English, but has Slovak translations)
and is aimed for Slovak teachers to introduce hardware (such as `BBC microbit <https://microbit.org/>`_) into computing
lessons at primary and secondary schools.

Nevertheless this djano app is flexible and can be used for any type on online education. It is pretty configurable via
settings, however you might find the templates opinionated since they use Bootstrap5.
